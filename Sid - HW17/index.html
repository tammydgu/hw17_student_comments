        <!-- Hey Sid! I figured out why your images weren't showing up. It looks like you werent' calling files correctly. It made have worked on your desktop because the files were called in a way that worked locally but wouldn't work elsewhere. Instead of calling images using C:\Users\sid27\Desktop\Ux_Ui_HW17\Images\Me.jpg, you should call them very simply using Images/name.png. Hope this helps for future github submissions! I also saw that you were defining a specific width for your background images. Instead of going pixel by pixel, which isn't responsive, use percentages or vw/vh. -->

    <div class="aboutme"> Bonjour!  My name is Sid Ahmed Ouadah, and I am a freelance UX/UI designer and quality analyst specialist. I have a background in law, sales, and digital advertising, which allows me to better understand and anticipate user needs. I enjoy turning raw ideas into useful and innovative products that enhance user experience. I discovered my passion for user experience a few years ago while working as a rideshare driver, seeing firsthand the many pain points myself and other drivers faced while driving and interacting with the app simultaneously.  My curiosity led me to seek out ways to improve this process, and after taking several online courses to better understand user experience and user needs, I confirmed that this was the right path for me. My desire to solve users problem quickly developed into a passion, and in 2021 I decided to further foster this by attending the UC Berkeley Extension bootcamp. This is where I gained much experience and a certificate in UX/UI design. Outside of design, I am a huge Football (or as  Americans call it, Soccer   ) fan, and enjoy exploring the great outdoors and trying new food.
    Currently,I am open to new opportunities and fun projects. Please do not hesitate to contact me!
